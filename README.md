Screenshots
-----------
This project uses [termbox-go](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go) to create the ui and to handle keyboard events. That's why there is only a limited number of available colors. It is not pretty but it's compatible with every terminal.

I like to play in the [guake](https://github.com/Guake/guake) terminal with the Zenburn color theme.
